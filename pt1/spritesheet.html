	<h1>What is a Sprite Sheet?</h1>
	<p>Sprite sheets already exist since the first days of computer games. <br>The idea is to create one big image that contains all animations of a character instead of dealing with many single files. They got less important for some time after more and more 3d games showed up - but got their big comeback with mobile devices and 2d games.</p>

	<p>Originally sprites referred to independent objects that are composited together, by hardware, with other elements such as a background. This occurs as each scan line is prepared for the video output device, such as a CRT, without involvement of the main CPU and without the need for a full-screen frame buffer.</p>

	<p>Use of the term sprite has expanded to refer to any two-dimensional bitmap used as part of a graphics display, even if drawn into a frame buffer (by either software or a GPU) instead of being composited on-the-fly at display time.</p>

	<h2>How to make a sprite sheet?</h2>
	<br />
	<h3>Step 1</h3>
	<p>Make an animation strip. Place each animation frame next to each other. All frames have the same size, and the animation is aligned in each frame.</p>
	<img id=step1 src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4bfd585b71682a65d1d0afe7912ad7002e5dfaba/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f46444873752e706e67">

	<p>You can also create a tileset from a sprite sheet. A tileset usually contains roads or building blocks for game levels.</p>

	<p>But in this format, the sprites waste a lot of memory, because of all the additional transparency.</p>

	<h4>Step 2</h4>
	<p>To optimize the unnecessary space, remove the transparency surrounding the sprite and shrink it to the bounding box.</p>

	<p>The game engine now needs additional information to draw the sprite: It needs to know where the sprite is located and how much transparency was removed.</p>
