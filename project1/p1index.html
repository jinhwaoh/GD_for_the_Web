<div class="txt">Opposition to the Republican health care <span class="bill">bill</span> strengthened Wednesday, as key <span class="industry">industry</span> groups that had supported Obamacare said the replacement backed by President <span class="donald">Donald</span> Trump could <span class="harm">harm</span> vulnerable <span class="us">Americans</span>.<br>

But the <span class="wh">White House</span> and Republican congressional leaders brushed off criticism as they <span class="seek">seek</span> to fast track the legislation through Congress. Democrats made clear it wouldn't be easy -- dragging out a <span class="hard">grueling</span> day of committee sessions long into the <span class="night">night</span>.
In two committee rooms, GOP lawmakers dismissed <span class="q">questions</span> about the <span class="bill">bill</span>'s cost and claims it would result in millions of Americans losing insurance coverage. Democrats mixed assaults on the legislation with diversionary tactics meant to embarrass Trump -- such as highlighting his refusal to release his <span class="tax">tax</span>returns.<br>
The action on Capitol Hill comes against a backdrop of pitched controversy over the legislation, which is posing a crucial first test to Trump's capacity to move his agenda through Congress and as conservative Republicans complain that the initiative does not go far enough in erasing his predecessor Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.<br>
The American <span class="medi">Medical</span> Association, which <span class="bill">bills</span> itself as the largest organization of doctors in the nation, sent a letter to the two committees, detailing its critique of the <span class="bill">bill</span>, known as the American Health Care Act.<br>
"While we agree that there are problems with the ACA that must be addressed, we cannot support the AHCA as drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential <span class="harm">harm</span> it would cause to vulnerable patient populations," the letter stated.<br>
Major <span class="hp">hospital</span> organizations, including the American<span class="hp">Hospital</span> Association and the Federation of American <span class="hp">hospitals</span> have also come out against the <<span class="bill">bill</span>. The largest seniors organization, the AARP had warned on Tuesday the measure would weaken  <span class="medi">Medicare</span> and Medicaid. Some conservative < <span class="medi">medical</span> lobby groups have supported the measure.<br>
<span class="wh">White House</span> spokesman Sean Spicer shrugged off the building opposition from the  <span class="medi">medical</span> establishment.<br>
"We would love to have every group on board," Spicer said, adding, "This isn't about figuring out how many special interests in Washington we can get paid off. It's about making sure that patients get the best deal, that lowers prices and brings back cost."<br>
